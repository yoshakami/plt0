yeah, I decided to implement my own markdown again.
"\a" = %appdata%
"\b" = sets the current label's text to bold
"\c Cyan " makes the text of the current label be Cyan. - put "quotes" around the colour name if it has spaces
"\d" = depth of input_file
"\e" = executable name
"\f default " font name of the current label - put "quotes" around the font name if it has spaces
"\g 128 " = GdiCharSet of the current label 
"\h" = height of the window
"\i" = set current label's text to italic
"\j" = jump to the next label - can't be the same line as the one you're on (else an override occurs and previous text can't be seen)
"\k" = knit a strikeout text style
"\l" = Layout name that you're browsing
"\m" = mipmaps number
"\n" = new line
"\o" = output file name
"\p" = path of the executable (execPath, full path to the folder )
"\q Point " = query a font size unit for current label 
"\r" = r carriage return
"\s 15 " changes the size of the text in the current label
"\t" = tab
"\u" = underline the whole text of current label
"\v" = Vertical font set to false for current label
"\w" = window width
"\xff" = a byte, can be \xfa, or \x80, whatever hex byte works
"\y" = y-axis block height of selected encoding
"\z" = z-axis block depth of selected encoding
"\0" = 0utputs the x-axis block width of selected encoding


notes: 
colour names are all the ones allowed in System.Drawing.Color
\v (GdiVerticalFont = true by default) see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.font.gdiverticalfont?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0
\q values are {"World", "Pixel", "Point", "Inch", "Document", "Milimeter", "Display"}
\g is actually the encoding, 0 is ANSI for example. see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.font.gdicharset?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0
if it doesn't have quotes, make markdown with arguments always end with a space (\c \f \g \j \q \s)
the byte \x00 must always have 2 digits (that way, the program know where it ends, and you don't need to add a ending character after it)


you can use \j 8 times at most in one line of this .txt
this is because labels override each other :/ even though its back is transparent, it won't allow the text of the other label back him to show
