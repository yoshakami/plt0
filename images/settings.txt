yeah, I decided to implement my own markdown again.
"\a" = %appdata%
"\b" = sets the current label's text to bold
"\c Cyan " makes the text of the current label be Cyan. - put "quotes" around the colour name if it has spaces
"\d" = depth of input_file
"\e" = executable name
"\f default " font name of the current label - put "quotes" around the font name if it has spaces
"\g 128 " = GdiCharSet of the current label 
"\h" = height of the window
"\i" = set current label's text to italic
"\j" = jump to the next label - can't be the same line as the one you're on (else an override occurs and previous text can't be seen)
"\k" = knit a strikeout text style
"\l" = Layout name that you're browsing
"\m" = mipmaps number
"\n" = new line
"\o" = output file name
"\p" = path of the executable (execPath, full path to the folder )
"\q Point " = query a font size unit for current label 
"\r" = r carriage return
"\s 15 " changes the size of the text in the current label
"\t" = tab
"\u" = underline the whole text of current label
"\v" = Vertical font set to false for current label
"\w" = window width
"\xff" = a byte, can be \xfa, or \x80, whatever hex byte works
"\y" = y-axis block height of selected encoding
"\z" = z-axis block depth of selected encoding
"\0" = 0utputs the x-axis block width of selected encoding
notes: 
colour names are all the ones allowed in System.Drawing.Color
\v (GdiVerticalFont = true by default) see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.font.gdiverticalfont?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0
\q values are {"World", "Pixel", "Point", "Inch", "Document", "Milimeter", "Display"}
\g is actually the encoding, 0 is ANSI for example. see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.font.gdicharset?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0
if it doesn't have quotes, make markdown with arguments always end with a space (\c \f \g \j \q \s)
the byte \x00 must always have 2 digits (that way, the program know where it ends, and you don't need to add a ending character after it)

you can use \j 8 times at most in one line of this .txt
this is because labels override each other :/ even though its back is transparent, it won't allow the text of the other label back him to show

option asking you to press enter before the console window disappears in cli mode
when decoding, the program will write a 32-bit bmp in any case (else I've optimized bit depth to make file size smaller depending while keeping all image data intact)
force your alpha value to be applied even if the input image isn't a 32-bit RGBA image (will output a fully transparent image in most cases)
when decoding, will write raw data, making a funky result
won't inform the user that he made mistakes
fill the colour palette with random values for CI4, CI8, and CI14x2 formats
I have nothing more to describe here, output will be vertically and horizontally reversed
makes the program to never throw any exception (useful when using subprocess.checkoutput in python)

palette, 14 bits per pixel (CI14x2 palette has a capacity of 16384 colours)
color, 2 RGB565 colours per 4x4 block + 2 interpolated colours\n (which results in a "4-bit per pixel") - use the Paint layout to edit CMPR textures - default algorithm cares about CMPR Max colours in each 4x4 block and every pixel with alpha < CMPR Min alpha will be zero, else it's 255

Multiplies each channel by its value in the textbox "Custom RGBA"
Make the encoding of CMPR textures to only care about the two most used colours with diversity and percentage parameters
States that the picture has No alpha and that every pixel of RGB5A3 must be 1RRR RRGG GGGB BBBB(used in RGB5A3's smart alpha and for choosing palette encoding if none were selected)
States that the picture has Alpha and that every pixel of RGB5A3 must be 0AAA RRRR GGGG BBBB
Picture has alpha and RGB5A3 can use any of the two options for each pixel
repeats the last pixel horizontally indefinitely when looking out of the texture canvas
paste the whole texture horizontally when looking out of the texture canvas
reverse horizontally each occurence of the texture (used to make textures with twice the width stored in half the size)
repeats the last pixel vertically indefinitely when looking out of the texture canvas
paste the whole texture vertically when looking out of the texture canvas
reverse vertically each occurence of the texture (used to make textures with twice the height stored in half the size)
